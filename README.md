# Bank-Account-Simulation
The objective of this project is to simulate the basic operations of a bank account using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Java. This program demonstrates how real-world banking transactions such as deposits, withdrawals, and balance inquiries can be modeled using classes and objects.
